Possible Changes - RoadMap

-jasmine specRunner (karma?)
-source maps
-http module
-Reduce dependency from jQuery to zero?
-Possiblity to create adapters for other js libraries
(jquery, jquerylite, mootols, prototype...) and our own Default implementation
(current needs: match an element to a CSSExpression, save/retrieve data on DOMElement)

-Add tests coverage tool
-Rework samples to more beautiful presentation (bootstrap?)
-Extract directives from current CMS

-Change timeout for DOMSubTreeChanged y MutationObserver when available

    http://help.dottoro.com/ljrmcldi.php
    TimedDOMObserver
    DOMChangeObserver
    MutationObserver
    (previous refactor, extract to TimedDOMObserver)

-Â¿Expose current internal APIs as public?

-Possibility to create POO style or Functional style directives

-Add destroy (optional) method to directives to call when DOMElements are removed
    (to clearTimeouts, cancel current operations, free resources...)

-Change CSSExpression to mustApply(). A method/function is more expressive

-

-Document api with doku + github pages (jasmine docs style)
