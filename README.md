# `oblique.js`

`oblique.js` is a framework that lets your structure web apps by providing:

+ **Directives** to organise & execute code in page
+ **Model & model selection** to bind data in page with code & DOM elements
+ **Params** to send config data to code
+ **Templates** to do big DOM manipulations (uses [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/))

## Requeriments

Currently `oblique.js` needs  [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to work properly. If you want to use the template system, you need to load also [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/).

## Installation

Just download `oblique.js` or `oblique.min.js` file and load it after [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and (optionally) [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)

```<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josecgil/oblique-js/master/dist/oblique.min.js"></script>```

## An overview

`oblique.js` constantly searchs the entire DOM tree for elements with the `data-ob-directive` attribute. When an element is found, it process it and marks the element as 'processed' so the next time does'nt find it.

At the core of `oblique.js` the are a two elements: 
+ a DOM Element thats declares code to execute and data to be sent to the code.
+ a javascript constructor function (or more than one) that will be called when oblique.js finds the element

The most simple DOM element look like this:

```<p data-ob-directive="HelloDirective">simple example</p>```

It has an important attribute `data-ob-directive`, that declares the name of the constructor function that `oblique.js` must call when it finds this element. When the element is found it instantiates a new object with the constructor function (in this case, `new HelloDirective()`).

Previously, `HelloDirective` must be registered as a function in `oblique.js`

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    var HelloDirective=function() {
        console.log("Hello world!");
    };
    
    Oblique().registerDirective("HelloDirective", HelloDirective);
</script>
```

The same example in a more concise way:

```
<script type="text/javascript">    
    Oblique().registerDirective("HelloDirective", function() {
        console.log("Hello world!");
    });
</script>
```

These functions are called `Directives` in `oblique.js` jargon. Hence the name of the function `HelloDirective`. Directives are like an orchestra conductor, they are the core of the execution process.

Directives are registered through the `Oblique().registerDirective()` function, as you can see `Oblique()` is the function through which you can access all the functionality of `oblique.js`.

## Execution lifecycle

In `oblique.js` it goes like this:

+ When `oblique.js` is loaded and the DOM is ready it sets a timer to search the DOM every 400ms
+ on every execution
   + it searchs for elements with the `data-ob-directive` attribute not already processed
   + it extracts all the directives names declared in element
   + it parse the attributes beginning with data-ob and builds a 'data' object
   + it instantiate a new object with the constructor function named like the directive and it sends a [data](#the-data-param) object as the first param

## The data param

All `Directives` receive a `data` param with info related to the context of the DOM element that triggers its excution and more data from the page (controlled by the `data-ob-model` & `data-ob-params` attributes). 

`data` is a params that contains several properties:

+ `domElement`: the HTMLElement that contains the `data-ob-element` attribute that triggers its execution
+ `jQueryElement`: the same as before, but the `jQuery` counterpart
+ `params`: any params that the DOM element has, in this case this is undefined, it works with the `data-ob-params` attribute
+ `model`: any data that you want to bind to this directive, in this case this is undefined, it works with the `data-ob-model` attribute

## The data-ob-params attribute

The `data-ob-params` is a form to send config params to a directive. The format of the params is JSON.

```
<p data-ob-directive="PopupDirective" data-ob-params="{\"width\":\"200px\", \"height\":\"100px\"}">Popup content</p>
```

In this example, the `PopupDirective` will receive a JSON object in the `data.params` property:

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    var PopupDirective=function(data) {
        var params=data.params;
        //Popup code
    };
    
    Oblique().registerDirective("PopupDirective", PopupDirective);
</script>
```

`data-params` value would be 
```
{
    width:"200px",
    height:"100px"
}
```

##The Model

In oblique.js the Model is the data needed by the page. There are three related items that works with the model.

+ The `Oblique.setModel()` function, that sets all the data for the page (as an object)
+ The `data-ob-model` attribute that selectes what data goes to the directive
+ The `Model` reserved word (used inside `data-ob-model` attribute)

Let's start with the `Oblique().setModel()` function. It inform `oblique.js` that all directives in the page has the possibility to work with some kind of data.

`data-ob-model` then selects what part of the Model is send to a directive in a concrete case.

###A simple example

Let's say you have a data in you page refered to the current logged user:

```
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var loggedUser={ name: "josecgil", isPremium: true };
    </script>
```

And an image in the html that you what to show only when the logger user is a premium user.

```
    <img src="/images/premium_user.jpg" />
```

To code the behaviour of showing the image or not you need to write javascript. The place to do this in `oblique.js` is to create and register a `Directive`:

```
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var PremiumBadgeDirective=function() {
            //code to show or hide premium image
        };
        
        Oblique().registerDirective("PremiumBadgeDirective", PremiumBadgeDirective);
    </script>

```

To bind this `Directive` to the tag you need to set an attribute `data-ob-directive` with the name of the registered directive:

```
    <img src="/images/premium_user.jpg" data-ob-directive="PremiumBadgeDirective" />
```

But, to show or hide the image you need the data of the current logged user. Â¿How to send the needed data to the `PremiumBadgeDirective`?

1. Set the model in `oblique.js`

```
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var loggedUser={ name: "josecgil", isPremium: true };
        Oblique().setModel(loggedUser);
    </script>

```

2. Select the part of the model you want to pass in `data-ob-model` attribute. If you use the reserved work `Model` it means all the data set previously in `Oblique.setModel()` will be sent to the directive.

```
    <img src="/images/premium_user.jpg" data-ob-directive="PremiumBadgeDirective" data-ob-Model="Model"/>
```
This tag declares that will execute a function registered as "PremiumBadgeDirective" and that it will send all the Model data to it (that what the reserved word 'Model' means). 

The final javascript code looks like this:

```
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var PremiumBadgeDirective=function(data) {
            isPremiumUser=data.Model.isPremium;
            premiumImage=data.jQueryElement;
            if (isPremiumUser) {
                premiumImage.show();
            } else {
                premiumImage.hide();
            }
        };
        
        Oblique().registerDirective("PremiumBadgeDirective", PremiumBadgeDirective);
    
        var loggedUser={ name: "josecgil", isPremium: true };
        Oblique().setModel(loggedUser);
    </script>

```
